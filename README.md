# URL Shortener

Just a practice project to make a URL shortener with React, from [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/link-shortener-website-brqjanf6zq).

It might take a few seconds on the first usage, since I made use of a proxy server to do the actual API call to Bitly.
This way the API key can be hidden and not visible to client side.

## Known issues and potential improvements
- No invalid url handling
  - Seems like the url must begin with http or https
- Shows up weird on iPad
  - has border-radius effect even when works fine on other devices.
